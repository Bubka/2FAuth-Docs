# Bug reporting

Found a bug? A report from you would be greatly appreciated!

## GitHub issues

The preferred way to report a bug is to open an issue on GitHub.

GitHub eases the creation of issues by providing a template which encourage you to give as much information as possible on what's going on and the technical context.

!!! Good practice
Check the existing issues before creating a new one, maybe your issue has already been reported.
