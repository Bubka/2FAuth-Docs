# Self-hosted server

You can deploy 2FAuth on your own web server, whether on your local computer or a web host.
The following guide describes how to proceed and gives basic configurations for both NGINX and Apache2 web servers.  

## Requirements

### HTTP server

__Apache__ and __NGINX__ are the most popular web servers. If you rent a server or web hosting, you probably already have one of them installed. If you plan to use your own machine and need help installing and configuring a web server, please consider searching the Web, as there are many tutorials to guide you through.

- <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=install+apache2" target="_blank">Google search for `install apache2`</a>
- <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=install+nginx" target="_blank">Google search for `install nginx`</a>

### PHP

- PHP >= [!badge 8.1]
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

Depending on the chosen database (see below), don't forget to install the corresponding PHP extension (i.e `php8.1-sqlite3` or `php8.1-mysql`)

### Database

You need a database to run 2FAuth. Supported databases are the ones supported by Laravel.

- MariaDB [!badge 10.2+]
- MySQL [!badge 5.7+]
- PostgreSQL [!badge 9.6+]
- SQLite [!badge 3.8.8+]
- SQL Server [!badge 2017+]

!!! Recommendation
2FAuth is a very light application with minimal needs and few concurrent connections. __SQLite__ is definitely the best choice if you plan to use 2FAuth in a single-user context or in a multi-user context with a limited number of users. Otherwise prefer a server-based __SQL__ database.
!!!

### Composer

You need __Composer__ to install all PHP dependencies of 2FAuth. As the installation process of Composer may change depending on your operating system, please follow the instructions provided on the official website:

[!ref icon="package-dependents" target="blank" text="Install Composer"](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

You can test your installation by running `php composer.phar -v` in a terminal (or just `composer -v` if composer has been installed in a directory that is part of your system PATH)

## Get your 2FAuth copy

Here are 3 methods to help you download the 2FAuth source code. For the purpose of this guide we will consider `/var/www/2fauth` (which is a common path in the *nix world) to be the location where 2FAuth will sit. Of course, you are free to use another path, just remember to adapt the commands in the following steps with yours.

+++ Download from GitHub

1. Download the source code of the <a href="https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/releases/latest" target="_blank">latest 2FAuth release</a>, say v4.1.0
2. Extract the archive and open the `2fauth-4.1.0` folder it contains
3. Move its content to `/var/www/2fauth`

+++ Using CLI

=== Get the latest release

```bash
curl https://api.github.com/repos/Bubka/2FAuth/tags | grep "tarball_url" | \
    grep -Eo 'https://[^\"]*' | sed -n '1p' | xargs wget -O - | tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C /var/www/2fauth
```

=== Get a specific release

```bash
# list existing 2FAuth versions
curl https://api.github.com/repos/Bubka/2FAuth/releases | grep "\"name\"" | grep -Eo 'v[^\"]*'
# Replace x.y.z with the version of your choice
wget -qO- "https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/archive/refs/tags/x.y.z.tar.gz" | \
    tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C /var/www/2fauth
```

===

+++ Using Git

=== Get the latest release

```bash
cd /var/www/2fauth
git clone https://github.com/bubka/2fauth.git .
curl https://api.github.com/repos/Bubka/2FAuth/releases/latest | grep "\"name\"" | grep -Eo 'v[^\"]*' | xargs git checkout
```

=== Get a specific release

```bash
cd /var/www/2fauth
git clone https://github.com/bubka/2fauth.git .
# list existing 2FAuth versions
git tag
# Replace 3.0.0 with the version of your choice
git checkout v3.0.0
```

===

+++

## Installing dependencies

### Composer

From the `/var/www/2fauth/` directory:

```sh
composer install --prefer-dist --no-scripts --no-dev
```

Or if you didn't add composer to your system PATH:

```sh
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist --no-scripts --no-dev
```

## Web server configuration

As a reminder, the intended installation path is `/var/www/2fauth`. The given commands/scripts should be modified if you are using another path.

+++ NGINX

Set your NGINX configuration in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` as :

```nginx
events {}
http {
  include mime.types;

  access_log /dev/stdout;
  error_log /dev/stderr;

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name 2fAuth;
      root /var/www/2fauth/public;

      index index.php;

      charset utf-8;

      location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
      }

      location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
      location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

      error_page 404 /index.php;

      location ~ \.php$ {
          fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
          fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
          include fastcgi_params;
      }

      location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
          deny all;
      }
  }
}
```

You can verify the Nginx configuration is valid with:

```sh
nginx -t
```

+++ Apache2

Add a new virtual host:

```bash
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo nano 2fauth.conf
```

Add the following to the newly created file:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/2fauth/public

    <Directory /var/www/2fauth/public>
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

!!!warning
Remember to replace example.com with your domain
!!!

Save and close the file, then enable the new VHost and restart Apache2:

```bash
# Assuming 000-default.conf is your current enabled v-host
# Disable the current v-host
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf

# Enable the 2fauth v-host
sudo a2ensite 2fauth

# Restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

+++

### Custom base url

You may access 2FAuth from a custom base url, like `mydomain.org/2fauth/`. This is helpful if you do not want to define a dedicated (sub-)domain for 2FAuth.

For such a setup, you only need to add an alias to your existing server configuration:

+++ NGINX

```nginx
location /2fauth/ {
    alias /var/www/2fauth/public/;
}
```

+++ Apache2

```apache
<IfModule alias_module>
    Alias /2fauth "/var/www/2fauth/public/"
</IfModule>
```

+++

## Create the database

Use the CLI of the chosen database to create a new database with one of the following commands:

+++ SQLite

```sh
sqlite> .open /var/www/2fauth/database/database.sqlite
sqlite> .quit
```

Reference

[!ref icon="book" target="_blank" text="Command Line Shell For SQLite"](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#opening_database_files)

+++ MySQL / MariaDB

```mysql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE 2fauth;
```

Reference

[!ref icon="book" target="_blank" text="Creating database with MySQL"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/creating-database.html)
[!ref icon="book" target="_blank" text="Creating database with MariaDB"](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/create-database)

+++ PostgreSQL

```sql
CREATE DATABASE 2fauth
```

Reference

[!ref icon="book" target="_blank" text="Creating database with PostgreSQL"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html)

+++

If you are not comfortable with the command line, you may use a db management tool like _Adminer_ to ease this step.

[!ref icon="package-dependents" target="blank" text="Get Adminer"](https://www.adminer.org/)

## 2FAuth set up (wizard)

2FAuth provides an __artisan__ command to set up everything easily. If you want to set up all by hand, please follow the next section: [2FAuth set up (manual)](#2fauth-set-up-manual).

### Prerequisites

Except if you want to use sqlite (in this case the wizard create the db file for you) you need a database server up and running for which you will provide the url.

### Execution

Open a command prompt on `/var/www/2fauth/`, run the following command and answer the wizard questions.

```sh
php artisan 2fauth:install
```

At the end of the wizard, 2FAuth should be ready to start. Please see [Troubleshooting](/getting-started/troubleshooting/) if something goes wrong.

!!!warning
You should review the [email](#email) configuration section of the .env file to allow 2FAuth to send emails during the reset password process.
!!!

What the wizard do for you is :

- Create the .env file
- Configure general environment variables
- Configure and migrate the database
- Configure the authentication passport
- Create the symbolic link for the storage location
- Cache the configuration

All these steps are detailed below if you want to dive into them.

## 2FAuth set up (manual)

### Set the .env file

Run the following command from the `/var/www/2fauth` directory to create a fresh `.env` file from the `.env.example` template:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file with a text editor, you will find the main environment variables that could be customized.  
You won't have to set/change all, most of them have a default value that will probably fit your needs. But some parts must be reviewed.

!!!secondary
See [Configuration](/getting-started/config/env-vars/) to learn about all the environment variables that can be set.
!!!

#### Database

+++ When using SQLite

Set the path to your SQLite database file:

```env
# Unix style
DB_DATABASE="/var/www/2fauth/database/database.sqlite"

# Windows style
DB_DATABASE="C:\\path\\to\\your\\database.sqlite"
```

+++ When using MySQL / MariaDB

Uncomment the dedicated lines (and comment the SQLite ones) and replace values with yours:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=ip.of.your.server
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=2fauth
DB_USERNAME=sqlUserName
DB_PASSWORD=sqlUserPassword
```

+++ When using PostgreSQL

Uncomment the dedicated lines (and comment the SQLite ones) and replace values with yours:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=ip.of.your.server
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=2fauth
DB_USERNAME=sqlUserName
DB_PASSWORD=sqlUserPassword
```

+++

#### Email

Email configuration depends on your email provider. You should refer to its documentation to find the relevant values.  
As an example, here is the configuration for an OVH hosting:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=SSL0.OVH.NET
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=john.doe@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=MyP4Ssw0rd
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl
MAIL_FROM_NAME="John"
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=john.doe@example.com
```

#### Subdirectory

In case you [previously](/getting-started/installation/self-hosted-server/#custom-base-url) configured your web server to serve 2FAuth from a custom-base url like `mydomain.org/2fauth/` you must edit the `APP_SUBDIRECTORY` .env var to match the server configuration.

```env /var/www/2fauth/.env
# no leading or trailing slash
APP_SUBDIRECTORY=2fauth
```

To complete the custom base url configuration, open the file `/var/www/2fauth/public/.htaccess`, uncomment the `RewriteBase` directive and edit the `subdir` value to match the `APP_SUBDIRECTORY` value:

```apache /var/www/2fauth/public/.htaccess
    # Uncomment and set the RewriteBase path to the desired subdirectory if you want to
    # serve 2FAuth from a domain subdirectory like https://mydomain/2fauth/
    #
    # WARNING: the subdirectory value must match the one set in your .env file
    # Do not forget leading and trailing slashes.
    RewriteBase /2fauth/
```

### Run Artisan commands

Run the following `Artisan` commands from the `/var/www/2fauth/` directory to set up the Laravel part:

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
php artisan passport:install
php artisan storage:link
php artisan config:cache
```
