## Why 2FAuth

Two-Factor Authentication has become very popular in recent years, resulting in more and more situations where we face a security code request and an increase in the number of accounts protected by this technology. In other words, 2FA is now inevitable and critical.

2FAuth's purpose is to simplify how you use and manage your 2FA with a clean and suitable interface, no matter what device you use. In front of your computer without your smartphone and dealing with a code request? No problemo, just open your 2FAuth instance in a browser tab and voil√†!

Moreover, as an open source and self-hosted application, it lets you regain control over your personal security data, giving you privacy and the ability to back it up (Have you lost a smartphone with all your 2FA accounts inside Google Auth? I did... it really sucked)
